UPF Linköping took a field trip to Stockholm from Friday, 29 April to Saturday, 30 April for a seminar on EU Crisis Management at the Swedish Institute for European Policy Studies (SIEPS) (https://www.sieps.se/en/about-sieps/) and other fun activities! Whether you were already an EU expert or not, this provided an exciting opportunity to learn about a current EU policy area, be it because of the climate crisis or COVID-19. You could also get to know UPF Linköping and the board a little better and meet like minded people to explore Stockholm with!
