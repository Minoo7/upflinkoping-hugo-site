Oh, the weather outside is frightful!

Get cozy, kick up your feet, and settle in for a road trip through the deep American south in the sixties with us as we view Green Book, a film by Peter Farrelly.

Bring your friends and a blanket and settle in for a night of traditional winter at our very own version of a movie theater, of course little snacks are included.
