It’s 1598, and Duke Charles has just led Linköping to victory in the battle of Stångebro, effectively ending the reign of king Sigismund of Poland. The villagers are relieved that the war has finally finished and want to resume their peaceful lives; however, they are not so fortunate as a band of ravenous werewolves has settled in the city. 🐺🌙

Every night, they murder one resident and feast on their blood. The terrified villagers fear for their lives. Thus, they assemble to combat the werewolves! But how do they distinguish between werewolves and humans? During the day, 'regular' individuals reside in the village, but only at night do they reveal their true nature. Every morning, the residents of Linköping convene a council to denounce a potential werewolf. In an effort to restore the village’s safety, following a lengthy deliberation, one individual is executed.

Do you enjoy being convincing and deceitful? Or searching for opportunities to tell lies and emerge as the greatest Werewolf in history? 🧐

The game will be lead by a great storyteller who will offer you your role and all relevant information, so no prior knowledge is required to participate.
