Every year, upf link√∂ping organises one longer trip to a location of political interest anywhere in the world. previous travels included stops in israel, russia, and hungary, to mention a few. during these visits, we hope to provide our members with the chance to meet with various governmental bodies and local ngo:s, as well as see historical places and experience local culture.
