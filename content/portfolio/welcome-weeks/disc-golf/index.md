Imagine this: sunshine ☀️, a gentle breeze 🍃, and a frisbee 🥏 soaring through the air. On August 5th at 14.30 we extend a warm invite to join us for a game of disc golf.

New to the game? Don’t fret! If disc golf sounds as alien 👽 to you as your new campus 🏫, we’ve got you covered. We’ll turn you from a novice to a disc golf hotshot in no time! ⚡️
