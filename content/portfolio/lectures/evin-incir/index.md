ðŸ’¡ For our next exciting lecture of the semester, UPF LinkÃ¶ping invites you to a presentation and discussion with Swedish Member of the European Parliament Evin Incir! ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

With one in three women in the EU having experienced physical and/or sexual violence, gender-based violence is a pressing issue in both the EU and the European Parliament, which is why Evin Incir (S) will discuss the criminalisation of gender-based violence in a landmark EU directive.
