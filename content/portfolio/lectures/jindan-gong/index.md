Transportation is of central importance for us; We need it, for example, for moving food and other items within and between countries, visiting friends and family as well as going on vacation and learning about new cultures. To reach Sweden's ambitious target of decreasing emissions from the transportation sector by 70% by 2030, technology is fast advancing through efficiency improvements, electrification, and the development of new renewable fuels. The question is; how should instruments for a transformation of the transportation system be designed to be perceived as fair and thus gain greater acceptance? Many of the instruments currently under consideration to reduce reliance on fossil fuels (for example, increased fossil fuel taxes, investments in public transportation, and bike lanes) have differing effects on urban and rural residents.

UPF Link√∂ping and Navitas have invited Jindan Gong, a research assistant at Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), to delve deeper into the broader topic of what equitable and sustainable mobility looks like in a future with fossil-free transport for persons from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and transport workers.
