We are happy to announce that Minister for Development Cooperation Matilda Ernkrans will visit Linköping University on Tuesday, August 30.

Join us at 16.30 at Lövverket, Studenthuset to discuss with the Minister how development cooperation is an act of international solidarity, as well as a necessity to mitigate the effects of climate change and conflict worldwide.
