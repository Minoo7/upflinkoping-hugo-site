Our association is taking part in the Welcome weeks, during this time we co-organize a selection of activities for new coming students. These events are usually Erasmus and exchange students oriented and are traditionally  in cooperation with other international associations (ESN, ISA). The welcome weeks take place twice a year at the beginning of a fall and winter semester. New international and Swedish students get to participate in a variety of social activities where they get to know each other and learn more about what the university and student life in Sweden has to offer. Activities such as Speed friending, Scavenger hunt, Campus tour or BBQ are usually organized during this period.
