In their book "Eurafrica: The Untold History of European Integration and Colonialism", Stefan Jonsson and Peo Hansen, professors at REMESO, Linköping University, reveal that a major motive for the founders of the European Union in the 1950s was their wish to jointly develop and exploit the African continent.

Join us for a lecture by Stefan Jonsson about Eurafrica: Why has this history been erased from histories of both European integration and colonialism? How did it contribute to the foundation of the EU? And why does it still matter in today’s international relations?
