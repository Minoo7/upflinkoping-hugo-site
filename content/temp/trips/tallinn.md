UPF Linköping went (T) ALL INN!
Five days, 17 students, one goal: Having a fun time exploring new city!

A boat ride across the Baltic Sea brought us to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. 🇪🇪
We enjoyed the beautiful ambience of the medieval old town, clinked our glasses in Estonian pubs and – of course – learned about politics and foreign affairs.
The Swedish Ambassador warmly welcomed us and gave us interesting insights into her work, and a visit to the Estonian parliament extended our knowledge about the politics and history of this Northern European country.

A big thank you to Estonia and all the people who made this the perfect kick-off trip for this semester!

*True to the motto “after the journey is before the journey”, so stay tuned for another UPF trip, currently in the making 😉
